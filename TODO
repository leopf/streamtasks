Refactor:
- better imports, find a unified way of doing this
- client
    - needs a uniform implementation of topics
        - noop receiver must go
          - how do we solve topic_is_subscribed in a better way
    - simplify receivers
        - one topic per receiver
        - have multi receivers that can turn on / off multiple receivers
        - must retain information like topics
    - receivers should be created outside the client
    - start stop client, with some standard receivers
    - reorder

Testing:
- topic control data


General:
- auto restarting tasks if they fail and are configured to do so
- every task factory provides a topic, this way the management server can subscribe and find out, if it is still running
