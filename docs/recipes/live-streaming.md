# Live Streaming

You can publish and consume live streams. This is supported by using the [input container](../tasks/media/inputcontainer.md) or [output container](../tasks/media/outputcontainer.md).

You can enter a RTMP/RTSP and other urls as the source or destination. Make sure to set the correct **format** in the container options. 

For further information look at the [ffmpeg streaming guide](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/StreamingGuide).
